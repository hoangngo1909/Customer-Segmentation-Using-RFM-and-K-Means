# Customer-Segmentation-Using-RFM-and-K-Means
From major consumers to exiting customers, all customers have diverse needs and wants. Businesses want customers to spend more from marketing campaigns, programs, new products to customers in different ways. However, the question is how to come up with the right marketing campaigns for the groups of customers who are in need, thereby increasing the response rate from customers and thereby increasing sales. . The problem is how to segment customers accurately based on the "historical transaction behavior" of customers, the RFM algorithm will help us solve this problem quickly. fast and efficient.  The problem consists of the following main stages: - From the raw data, calculate the Recency (R), Frequency (F), MonetaryValue (M) indexes of the RFM algorithm. - Visualize the data to review its distribution. Use Transformation techniques to return non-uniformly distributed data to a normal distribution. - Perform data scaling. - Use Elbow algorithm to find k suitable cluster values ​​for customer segmentation problem. - Apply K-means algorithm to segment customers from k values ​​found by Elbow algorithm and scaled data values. - Find out some features of clustered customer clusters.
